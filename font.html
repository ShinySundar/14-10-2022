	<p class="teresa">Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu (pronounced [bɔjaˈdʒiu]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa (Albanian: Nënë Tereza), was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun who, in 1950, founded the Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu (pronounced [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]) was born in Skopje—at the time, part of the Ottoman Empire.[a] After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most of her life. Saint Teresa of Calcutta[b] was canonised on 4 September 2016. The anniversary of her death is her feast day.</p>
